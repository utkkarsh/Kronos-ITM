				<p>Bottle Rockets soaring through the skies, Musicians and Dancers doing their gig, Robot Wars, Night Shows and much more... That's what it feels like to be surrounded with rush & excitement for those few awesome days. KRONOS, the annual techno-cultural festival organized in the largest group of institutions, ITM GOI and ITM University, is the biggest youth festival of central India. Initially, just started by few students in 2010, KRONOS is today in its 6th edition, having a 'footfall of over 18,000+ students'. Scheduled around for 3 days, the main motive of KRONOS is to bring out the competitive domain of students from within themselves and participate among different technical and cultural events. <br><br>

            The charm of KRONOS is such that not only the students from within the campus or state but also from other colleges across India come to participate. The events are designed to appeal to each and every group of students. There are many technical events like Robo Soccer, Print-A-Kart, Apathon etc and events on cultural out-front such as Pro-Nights and many others. The fest is initiated with various Lectures and Workshops on current field trends by eminent Industry Professionals. This tends to provide students with an informative edge along with all other fun. The event marks its ending with a night show, which usually is a concert by a famous singer or music band. 
<br><br>
            The aura and glory of KRONOS reaches to a new height every year embarking upon the minds of people, tale of a successful endeavor. To witness an out of this world experience, come and join us at ITM University where you are guaranteed to return every year for this amazing youth festival.
